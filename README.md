# Boom-0006<br>
AI-powered appointment setting agent that automates outbound sales and lead engagement for small and medium-sized businesses.<br>

To design and deploy an AI-powered appointment setting agent that automates outbound sales and lead engagement for small and medium-sized businesses. The agent will be capable of real-time communication (voice or chat), contextual understanding using preloaded business data, and booking appointments directly into the client's calendar systems—all without human intervention. This addresses SMB pain point: not enough time or expertise to drive consistent sales activity.<br>

Strategic Value to The Wealth Boom<br>
-> For Your Own Funnel: Automates prospecting for new M&A leads, LPs, or strategic partnerships.<br>
-> For Clients: Adds tangible sales value, enhancing the pitch and retention of SMBs post-acquisition or partnership.<br>
-> Platform Leverage: Integrated into your broader AI tool suite—paving the way for a full “AI Sales Team” feature set.<br>

# Goals of the AI Booking Agent<br>
Automate Lead Outreach & Qualification<br>
-> Reach out via voice or chat to leads (cold, warm, or inbound).<br>
-> Qualify leads based on predefined criteria (budget, timeline, interest, etc.).<br>
Schedule Appointments Automatically<br>
-> Seamlessly integrate with booking systems (Calendly, Google Calendar, Outlook).<br>
-> Handle time zone management and rescheduling.<br>
Context-Aware Conversations<br>
-> Pull in client-specific data (e.g., vertical, offer, value prop).<br>
-> Customize outreach pitch and responses accordingly.<br>
Scale Without Human BDRs<br>
-> Enable cost-effective sales activity at scale, 24/7.<br>
-> Reduce reliance on human SDR/BDR hiring and training.<br>
Client-Facing & Internal Use Cases<br>
-> Deployable both for internal appointment setting (e.g., wealth transfers, M&A advisory) and as a white-labeled tool offered to SMB clients.<br>

# Tech Stack<br>
Core Infrastructure<br>
-> Vapi.ai – Voice AI infrastructure with real-time conversational capabilities and easy agent scripting.<br>
-> LangChain / LlamaIndex – For memory, chaining, and retrieval of contextual data (e.g., specific business details, ICP templates).<br>
-> OpenAI GPT-4.5 or Claude 3 – LLM backend for generating natural conversations with leads.<br>
-> Pinecone / Weaviate – Vector database to manage lookalike customer embeddings and past conversations.<br>
-> Calendly API / Google Calendar API / Microsoft Graph API – For calendar management and scheduling integration.<br>
Additional Layers<br>
-> Twilio / Plivo – For telephony and voice routing if Vapi doesn’t handle full stack.<br>
-> Zapier / Make / n8n – For no-code automation hooks (e.g., CRM updates, email notifications).<br>
-> HubSpot / Salesforce / Pipedrive APIs – CRM sync for lead tracking.<br>
-> Notion / Airtable / Supabase – Lightweight CMS/DB for lead lists, ICP profiles, training data, and prompt logic management.<br>

# Training & Customization Strategy<br>
-> Business Profile Ingestion: Input key business information (offer, industry, tone, appointment goals).<br>
-> ICP Definition & Matching: Use internal lookalike algorithms to define whom to contact.<br>
-> Prompt Engineering / Fine-Tuning: Create business-specific response templates.<br>
-> Real-time Feedback Loop: Capture results ( e.g. booked, rejected, no answer) to refine agent behavior over time.<br>

# Phase 1: MVP Build<br>
-> Select Vapi.ai or similar stack to prototype.<br>
-> Integrate with a simple calendar (e.g., Calendly) and test outbound calls.<br>
-> Script a generic appointment-setting flow (e.g., "Hi, we help businesses in [INDUSTRY] with [VALUE PROP]. Can we get 15 mins on the calendar?").<br>
# Phase 2: Client Context Integration<br>
-> Add ability to ingest business-specific context (USP, pain points).<br>
-> Store in vector DB or embed in prompt/memory.<br>
# Phase 3: Lookalike ICP Matching<br>
-> Use existing data/CRM to generate outbound lists.<br>
-> Automate prospecting based on lookalike logic.<br>
-> Allow the agent to dynamically adjust its script for each ICP segment.<br>
# Phase 4: Multi-Channel & Feedback Loop<br>
-> Expand to email or SMS touchpoints before call.<br>
-> Track outcomes and retrain agent logic based on success patterns.<br>
-> Begin deploying to client accounts as a productized feature.<br>

# Future Expansions<br>
-> Add multilingual support.<br>
-> Build auto-lead-import flows from CRMs or scraped data.<br>
-> Integrate voice cloning for personal branding.<br>
-> Build agent dashboards with insights like “best time to call,” “script performance,” etc.<br>
