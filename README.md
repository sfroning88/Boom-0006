# Boom-0006
AI-powered appointment setting agent that automates outbound sales and lead engagement for small and medium-sized businesses.

To design and deploy an AI-powered appointment setting agent that automates outbound sales and lead engagement for small and medium-sized businesses. The agent will be capable of real-time communication (voice or chat), contextual understanding using preloaded business data, and booking appointments directly into the client's calendar systems—all without human intervention. This addresses SMB pain point: not enough time or expertise to drive consistent sales activity.

Strategic Value to The Wealth Boom
For Your Own Funnel: Automates prospecting for new M&A leads, LPs, or strategic partnerships.
For Clients: Adds tangible sales value, enhancing the pitch and retention of SMBs post-acquisition or partnership.
Platform Leverage: Integrated into your broader AI tool suite—paving the way for a full “AI Sales Team” feature set.

Goals of the AI Booking Agent
Automate Lead Outreach & Qualification
Reach out via voice or chat to leads (cold, warm, or inbound).
Qualify leads based on predefined criteria (budget, timeline, interest, etc.).
Schedule Appointments Automatically
Seamlessly integrate with booking systems (Calendly, Google Calendar, Outlook).
Handle time zone management and rescheduling.
Context-Aware Conversations
Pull in client-specific data (e.g., vertical, offer, value prop).
Customize outreach pitch and responses accordingly.
Scale Without Human BDRs
Enable cost-effective sales activity at scale, 24/7.
Reduce reliance on human SDR/BDR hiring and training.
Client-Facing & Internal Use Cases
Deployable both for internal appointment setting (e.g., wealth transfers, M&A advisory) and as a white-labeled tool offered to SMB clients.

Tech Stack
Core Infrastructure
Vapi.ai – Voice AI infrastructure with real-time conversational capabilities and easy agent scripting.
LangChain / LlamaIndex – For memory, chaining, and retrieval of contextual data (e.g., specific business details, ICP templates).
OpenAI GPT-4.5 or Claude 3 – LLM backend for generating natural conversations with leads.
Pinecone / Weaviate – Vector database to manage lookalike customer embeddings and past conversations.
Calendly API / Google Calendar API / Microsoft Graph API – For calendar management and scheduling integration.
Additional Layers
Twilio / Plivo – For telephony and voice routing if Vapi doesn’t handle full stack.
Zapier / Make / n8n – For no-code automation hooks (e.g., CRM updates, email notifications).
HubSpot / Salesforce / Pipedrive APIs – CRM sync for lead tracking.
Notion / Airtable / Supabase – Lightweight CMS/DB for lead lists, ICP profiles, training data, and prompt logic management.

Training & Customization Strategy
Business Profile Ingestion: Input key business information (offer, industry, tone, appointment goals).
ICP Definition & Matching: Use internal lookalike algorithms to define whom to contact.
Prompt Engineering / Fine-Tuning: Create business-specific response templates.
Real-time Feedback Loop: Capture results ( e.g. booked, rejected, no answer) to refine agent behavior over time.

Phase 1: MVP Build
Select Vapi.ai or similar stack to prototype.
Integrate with a simple calendar (e.g., Calendly) and test outbound calls.
Script a generic appointment-setting flow (e.g., "Hi, we help businesses in [INDUSTRY] with [VALUE PROP]. Can we get 15 mins on the calendar?").
Phase 2: Client Context Integration
Add ability to ingest business-specific context (USP, pain points).
Store in vector DB or embed in prompt/memory.
Phase 3: Lookalike ICP Matching
Use existing data/CRM to generate outbound lists.
Automate prospecting based on lookalike logic.
Allow the agent to dynamically adjust its script for each ICP segment.
Phase 4: Multi-Channel & Feedback Loop
Expand to email or SMS touchpoints before call.
Track outcomes and retrain agent logic based on success patterns.
Begin deploying to client accounts as a productized feature.

Future Expansions
Add multilingual support.
Build auto-lead-import flows from CRMs or scraped data.
Integrate voice cloning for personal branding.
Build agent dashboards with insights like “best time to call,” “script performance,” etc.
